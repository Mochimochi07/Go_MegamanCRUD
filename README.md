# Go_MegamanCRUD
Go no framework and no database CRUD about megaman.

This is my repo about megaman CRUD.

Feel free to use this as a file standard CRUD template like C++.

I know Go is not robust but having performance, concurrency and speed is a thing for software and data science.

The thing is I wanted to learn how to use Go like C++ and C since the sources that you might see in the web for c and c++ are just plain file functional CRUD.

Well, its just some sources and only few are Web frameworks that only few would use.

I know its not a good move to use Go for some games and software because people would prefer C, C# or C++ but its my curiosity that really matters.

I would like to be answering most of the questions in my head while sharing it to other devs.

I loved rockman when i was young and I used to play it in arcade and in NES.

Making this while i dream to code a humanoid robot would inspire me much on systems programming.
